# BEA_attack

Implementation of the attack described [here](https://www.intechopen.com/books/partition-based-trapdoor-ciphers/partition-based-trapdoor-ciphers) ([presentation at BH Europe 2017](https://youtu.be/uuC_dAnKQDM), [slides](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Filiol-By-Design-Backdooring-Of-Encryption-System-Can-We-Trust-Foreign-Encryption-Algorithms.pdf)) encountered during a CTF (`beard` challenge at the 2019 VolgaCTF qualifiers).

Unfortunately I couldn't finish the implementation of the attack in time for the CTF, but I intend to finish it and publish it here. For now it is in python as that's what I used during the CTF, but I might rewrite it in C++ if I need to for performance reasons.

# TO DO

+ Finish implementation
