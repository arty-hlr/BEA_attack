This is source code for solution of challenge Beard from VolgaCTF Quals 2019.

It's using SageMath Python2 version (e.g. version 8.9).

It's using older versino of cryptools framework (https://github.com/hellman/cryptools tag py2-archived).
(It is present in this archive)

How to run on a locally generated key:

First, generate some amount of pt/ct data. 0x30000 was enough for me.

$ sage2 playing.py

Stop manually after generated enough (can append later).

Preprocess data:

$ sage2 prepro.py

Run attack:

$ sage2 analyze.py

...
K11 [181, 286, 685, 452, 69, 798, 889, 480]

Put K11 inside analyze.py, run again

$ sage2 analyze.py

K11 [181, 286, 685, 452, 69, 798, 889, 480]
k10p [116, 441, 109, 457, 988, 409, 599, 391]
K10 (240, 512, 468, 36, 261, 381, 259, 428)
master key 414243443132333461626364 'ABCD1234abcd'
